                </h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Born in Mecca in 570 CE, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ (peace be upon him) was orphaned at a young age, first losing his father before birth, then his mother, and later his grandfather. He was raised by his uncle Abu Talib. Even before prophethood, he was known for his honesty, trustworthiness, and noble character, earning him the title "Al-Amin" (The Trustworthy) among his people. His early life was marked by simplicity and deep reflection.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                    He worked as a shepherd and later as a merchant, traveling with trade caravans. His upright conduct and integrity were well-known, and his wisdom was sought even in tribal disputes.

                </h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    At the age of 40, while meditating in the Cave of Hira, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ received the first revelation from Allah through the Angel Jibreel (Gabriel). This marked the beginning of his prophethood and the revelation of the Holy Quran. Initially, the message was spread secretly among close companions, but soon it became public, calling people to monotheism and justice.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                    The early years of his mission in Mecca were characterized by severe persecution and opposition from the Quraish, who felt threatened by his message challenging their polytheistic beliefs and social order. Despite immense hardship, the Prophet ﷺ remained steadfast in his mission.

                    Facing escalating persecution and a plot to assassinate him, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, accompanied by Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him), migrated from Mecca to Yathrib (later known as Medina) in 622 CE. This pivotal event, known as the Hijra, marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar and signified a new phase for Islam. In Medina, the Prophet ﷺ established the first Islamic state, fostering a community based on brotherhood, justice, and devotion to Allah.

                    In Medina, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ continued to receive revelations, and the principles of Islam were further established through laws, social norms, and guidelines for daily life. He unified various tribes, guided the nascent Muslim community through several defensive battles against the Meccan aggressors, and demonstrated exemplary leadership in both war and peace.

                    In 632 CE, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ performed his last pilgrimage to Mecca, known as the Farewell Pilgrimage (Hajjat al-Wada'). During this pilgrimage, he delivered a profound sermon reiterating the core principles of Islam, emphasizing human rights, equality, and the importance of adhering to the Quran and his Sunnah. Shortly after returning to Medina, he fell ill and passed away at the age of 63, having completed his mission and established Islam as a comprehensive way of life.
